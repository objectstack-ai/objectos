 * Canonical production origin — the origin every absolute URL in this module is
 * built on, and the `metadataBase` every relative metadata URL resolves against.
 *
 * Derived from `SITE_HOST` in `lib/site.ts`, which `middleware.ts` imports for
 * the canonical-domain redirect. That leaf module is now the single definition
 * of the host; this is the `https://` origin built on it, the only form any
 * node-runtime caller needs. Before it existed the host was spelled out twice,
 * here and in `middleware.ts`, with nothing enforcing that the two agreed.
 *
 * `middleware.ts` still cannot import anything from THIS module, and the
 * constraint has not softened — it has moved to `lib/site.ts`. Middleware runs
 * in the edge runtime; this module imports `lib/source.ts`, which drags the
 * fumadocs loader and every compiled MDX module into that bundle. Measured on
 * this tree: 149,745 B of edge JavaScript becomes 17,375,914 B, roughly 116x,
 * with `next build` still exiting 0 — so the cost surfaces at deploy on
 * Cloudflare Workers rather than in CI. `lib/site.ts` is the import that is
 * safe from both runtimes, and it stays safe only while it imports nothing.

/**
 * The locales that have a *real* translated source file for `slugs`.
 *
 * Why this cannot be read off the loader's own per-language APIs: `defineI18n`
 * leaves `fallbackLanguage` unset, which fumadocs resolves to `defaultLanguage`
 * — so every non-English locale's in-memory file system is constructed by
 * copying the English files in and letting real translations overwrite them.
 * The consequences, measured against fumadocs-core 16.8.12 with this repo's
 * content:
 *
 * - `source.getPages(lang)` and `source.getLanguages()` report 79 pages for
 *   *all seven* locales — they cannot tell a translation from a fallback.
 * - `source.getPages()` with no argument returns every locale's page set
 *   concatenated (553), not the default-language set.
 *
 * What does survive the copy is the file identity: `page.path` keeps the
 * ORIGINAL locale-suffixed filename it was authored under. A real Japanese page
 * is `operate/backup.ja.mdx`; an inherited fallback is the English
 * `operate/backup.mdx` under a `ja` lookup. Comparing against the English
 * page's path is therefore the discriminator, and it needs no filesystem access
 * at request time.
 *
 * English is the authored source (AGENTS.md: "English is the single source of
 * truth"), so it is present for every real page — and absent here only for a
 * translation-only file, which AGENTS.md forbids and which this function
 * correctly reports as having no English URL to advertise.
