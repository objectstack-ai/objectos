/**
 * Generate the Traditional Chinese (`zh-Hant`) docs surface from the Simplified
 * (`zh-Hans`) one.
 *
 * ## Why this locale is generated rather than translated
 *
 * Every other locale in `apps/docs/lib/i18n.ts` is a translation OF ENGLISH,
 * produced by the pass in `docs/TRANSLATION.md`. `zh-Hant` is not: Simplified
 * and Traditional Chinese are one language in two orthographies, so the
 * Traditional text is a deterministic transliteration of the Simplified text
 * and re-translating it from English would only introduce a second, divergent
 * Chinese voice. `www.objectos.ai` reached the same conclusion first and ships
 * its Traditional marketing pages this way (`scripts/gen-zh-hant.mjs` there,
 * converter in `src/lib/zhconvert.ts`); this is the docs site matching it,
 * including the converter and the conversion preset.
 *
 * ## Why the output is committed rather than converted at request time
 *
 * `lib/seo.ts`'s `translatedLocales()` tells a real translation from an
 * inherited English fallback by the IDENTITY OF THE SOURCE FILE — a real
 * Japanese page is `operate/backup.ja.mdx`, a fallback is the English
 * `operate/backup.mdx` under a `ja` lookup. A conversion performed while
 * rendering produces no `zh-Hant` file, so every Traditional page would be
 * classified as a fallback: the locale would render and switch correctly and
 * appear in no sitemap entry and no hreflang alternate. Invisible to search,
 * which is the entire reason the locale is being added.
 *
 * `.github/scripts/check-locale-surface.mjs` derives its oracle from the same
 * files, so the two agree by construction.
 *
 * ## What is converted, and what is not
 *
 * Fenced code blocks are copied through BYTE FOR BYTE, fence markers and info
 * strings included. `check-translation-output.mjs`'s `fence` rule pins a
 * translation's code samples to the English source's bytes, and a converter
 * rewriting a Han character inside a sample would break that on every page
 * carrying one. Everything outside a fence — frontmatter values, prose, table
 * cells, inline code — is converted. The fence machine below is deliberately
 * the same one that validator uses, so the two cannot disagree about where a
 * fence starts.
 *
 * The `translation:` stamp is carried across unchanged, and that is correct
 * rather than convenient: it records the sha256 of the ENGLISH sibling the
 * Simplified page was derived from, and the Traditional page is derived from
 * exactly that same English revision. So `check-translations.mjs` judges the
 * two together — when Simplified goes stale, Traditional goes stale with it,
 * and refreshing Simplified plus a regeneration clears both.
 *
 * ## Hand-editing is a gate, not a convention
 *
 * `--check` regenerates every file in memory and compares bytes. A hand edit to
 * a generated file, a `zh-Hant` file whose Simplified source has been deleted,
 * and a stale file left behind by a converter upgrade are all one failure with
 * one fix: edit the Simplified source (or, better, the English one) and re-run
 * the generator. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `--check` on every pull
 * request.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 *   pnpm --filter @objectos/docs gen:zh-hant          # write the Traditional set
 *   pnpm --filter @objectos/docs gen:zh-hant --check  # gate: exit 1 on any drift
