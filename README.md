# ObjectOS

> **The official runtime environment for ObjectStack applications** — operated
> for end-user organizations as **ObjectOS Cloud** (managed) and
> **ObjectOS Enterprise** (self-managed).

ObjectOS is a **commercial product**. This repository is its public home:

- 📚 **Documentation** — source for [docs.objectos.ai](https://docs.objectos.ai)
  (`content/docs/`, built by `apps/docs/`), in seven languages.
- 🐛 **Issue tracker** — bug reports and feature requests for ObjectOS Cloud
  and ObjectOS Enterprise.
- ™️ **Trademark policy** — [TRADEMARK.md](TRADEMARK.md). The "ObjectOS" name
  and logo are trademarks and are not covered by the code license.

The product source is developed privately and is not published in this
repository. There is no open-source edition of ObjectOS.

## Editions

One rate card, two deliveries — priced per **AI seat** in every edition:

| Delivery | Plans | For |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **ObjectOS Cloud** (managed service) | Free · Team · Business | Organizations that want the platform operated for them — orgs, environments, deploys, billing. |
| **ObjectOS Self-Managed** (your infrastructure) | Business Self-Managed (single-node license) · Enterprise (full private deployment) | Organizations that run the platform themselves. |

See [License & Pricing](https://docs.objectos.ai/docs/resources/license) for
plan details, and [docs.objectos.ai](https://docs.objectos.ai) for
capabilities, deployment, and operations documentation.

## Building and running your own apps? That's ObjectStack — and it's open source

Everything you need to **build, run, and self-host your own applications** is
the open-source (Apache-2.0) **[ObjectStack framework](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/framework)**:

```
ObjectStack  →  for builders  — the open-source protocol, toolkit, and production runtime
ObjectOS     →  for end users — the commercial runtime environment (Cloud & Enterprise)
```

`os start` — or the official Docker image
[`ghcr.io/objectstack-ai/objectstack`](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/framework/tree/main/docker) —
serves your compiled app in production with the Console, permissions, and
audit included. No commercial license required.

## What happened to the code that used to live here?

Until July 2026 this repository contained a free reference runtime
distribution (`@objectos/server`) and a desktop build (**ObjectOS One**).
As part of clarifying the ObjectStack / ObjectOS split:

- **`@objectos/server` is superseded** by the official ObjectStack runtime
  image (`ghcr.io/objectstack-ai/objectstack`) — the same capability,
  maintained where the runtime itself lives.
- **ObjectOS One is discontinued.** Demos and evaluations are served by the
  official Docker image and ObjectOS Cloud trials.
- **Everything already released stays licensed as released**: historical
  source remains available under Apache-2.0 in this repository's git history
  (archive branch: [`archive/apache-final`](https://github.com/objectstack-ai/objectos/tree/archive/apache-final)).
  Nothing is retroactively withdrawn.

## Working on the docs
